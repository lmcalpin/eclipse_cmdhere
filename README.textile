h1. eclipse_cmdhere

eclipse_cmdhere adds "Open Cmd window here..." and "Open Explorer window here..."
menu options when you select a single project, package, or source file.  The command prompt 
will open in the directory of a selected project or package, or the directory containing a 
selected source file.

h2. Installation

Build the jar and put it in your Eclipse dropins folder.

h2. Limitations

I wrote this for my own personal use, and so it has only been tested on Eclipse 3.7.
